So umm for some reason youre trying to code with this thing so heres how:

            'PIZZA' = draw rectangle,
            'BURGER' = get input,
            'SALAD' = display message,
            'SUSHI' = check for input,
            'TACOS' = set variable,
            'STEAK' = check variable,
            'RAMEN' = add num to var,
            'SANDWICH' = create label (so you can jump to it later),
            'CURRY' = jump to label,
            'KFC' = clear screen,
            'COOK': set function,
            'EAT': call function,
            'CHICKEN': multiply var,
            'TURKEY': divide var,
            'CHOCOLATE': check variable greater,
            'BROCCOLI': check variable less

            Definitions.txt is where to put ur arguments, U can add more space if u want
            Code.txt is where you wanna put your code.

            For the commands the amount of beans sets which command to execute. For example 3 beans would do the 3rd Command - SALAD
